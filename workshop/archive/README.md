# Archived Workshop Materials

These files represent stages that were removed from the workshop during restructuring:

- **stage2-meta-programming.md** - Self-validating skills (removed to simplify workshop)
- **stage3-orchestration-old.md** - Original chaos testing skill (replaced with simpler /api-explorer)
- **stage5-mcp-servers.md** - MCP server development (removed to focus on practical skills)
- **stage6-integration.md** - Integration and reflection (replaced with Showcase session)

## Why These Were Removed

The workshop was restructured to:
1. Focus on immediately practical skills
2. Reduce cognitive load (3 stages instead of 6)
3. Add more buffer time for questions and exploration
4. End with participant presentations instead of complex integration

## If You Want to Explore These Topics

These materials are still valuable for self-study:
- **Meta-programming** teaches self-validating skills that fix their own errors
- **Chaos testing** demonstrates complex parallel + sequential agent coordination
- **MCP servers** shows how to extend Claude's capabilities with custom tools
- **Integration** covers skill composition and team distribution

Feel free to work through these after the workshop!
