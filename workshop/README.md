# Advanced Claude Code Workshop: Meta-Programming & Skill Development

**Duration:** 10:30–16:00 (lunch 12:00–13:00)
**Audience:** Backend Python engineers familiar with Claude and LLM basics
**Focus:** Custom skills, agent orchestration, self-validation loops, MCP tooling, meta-programming

## Workshop Philosophy

The orbital-travel-planner is a vehicle for learning. The real goal is to build **reusable skills, validation harnesses, and agent coordination patterns** you'll use daily after this workshop.

By the end of today, you'll have:
- 3-5 custom skills installed in your Claude Code setup
- Understanding of agent orchestration patterns
- A custom MCP server extending Claude's capabilities
- Practical experience with self-validating AI workflows

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into 6 stages, each building on the previous one:

### Morning Sessions (10:30-12:00)

**[Stage 1: Foundations & Setup](./stage1-foundations.md)** (30 min)
Get hands-on with skills, agents, and MCP servers. Build your first custom skill.

**[Stage 2: Meta-Programming & Self-Validation](./stage2-meta-programming.md)** (60 min)
Create skills that orchestrate multiple agents and validate their own work.

### Afternoon Sessions (13:00-16:00)

**[Stage 3: Advanced Agent Orchestration](./stage3-orchestration.md)** (60 min)
Build complex agent coordination with parallel execution and dependency management.

**[Stage 4: Daily Workflow Skills](./stage4-workflow-skills.md)** (60 min)
Create practical, reusable skills for common engineering tasks beyond coding.

**[Stage 5: MCP Server Development](./stage5-mcp-servers.md)** (45 min)
Build a custom MCP server that extends Claude's capabilities for your domain.

**[Stage 6: Integration & Reflection](./stage6-integration.md)** (15 min)
Integrate your skills and prepare for daily use.

## Self-Paced Learning

Each stage includes:
- **Learning objectives** - What you'll master
- **Step-by-step instructions** - Follow along at your own pace
- **Code examples** - Copy-paste ready snippets
- **Success criteria** - How to verify you're on track
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Going deeper** - Extra challenges if you finish early

Can't make the workshop? No problem! These guides are designed to be self-sufficient.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Claude Code CLI installed and configured
- [ ] Python 3.9+ installed
- [ ] Git and GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed
- [ ] Text editor or IDE of choice
- [ ] The orbital-travel-planner repository cloned

## Quick Start

1. Start with [Stage 1: Foundations & Setup](./stage1-foundations.md)
2. Follow the stages in order
3. Don't skip success criteria checks
4. If stuck, check the troubleshooting section
5. Experiment and explore!

## Getting Help

During the workshop:
- Ask questions anytime
- Pair up with others if helpful
- Check the troubleshooting sections in each guide

After the workshop:
- Refer back to these guides
- Check the [Resources](./resources.md) page
- Share what you build with the team!

## What You'll Build

By the end of today, you'll have created:
- Custom skills for API validation, chaos testing, and workflow automation
- Agent orchestration patterns (parallel, sequential, background)
- Self-validating code loops
- A custom MCP server with domain-specific tools
- Documentation and examples to share with your team
